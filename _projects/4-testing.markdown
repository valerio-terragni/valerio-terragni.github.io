My research goal is to provide solutions to relevant software engineering problems that can greatly impact today's and tomorrow's society. An important problem that our society is facing is the increasing complexity of software systems, which makes correctness and quality assurance more difficult and expensive. 

Recently, I am working on imprving the testability of software. As a first step I recently published a new study on how to effectively measure software testability in the context of OO programs.
