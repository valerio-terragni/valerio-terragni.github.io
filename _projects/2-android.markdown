Another research area that I am interested in is the analysis of mobile applications, with a focus on  Android applications and the Google Play Store. This is a relevant and important research area as mobile devices have become an essential delivery platform for many businesses. 

During my PhD at HKUST, I collaborated to the project Elite a static analyzer that detects common patterns of wake lock misuses. I also collaborated with the Gran Sasso Science Institute and the University of Leipzig in the analysis of the Google Play Store for identifying emergent mobile development.

Currently I am working on the generation of GUI tests for Android applications. A GUI test consists of a sequence of GUI events. I am investigating concurrency bug detectors for Android Applications.
