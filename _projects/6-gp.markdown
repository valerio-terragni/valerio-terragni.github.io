Genetic Programming is a power family of optimization techniques. I am working on how to apply GP techniques for SE problems, expecially testing. 

I recenlty proposed GAssert (Genetic ASSERTion improvement), the first technique to automatically improve assertions oracles. GAssert uses a novel evolutionary algorithm that explores the space of possible assertions to identify a better assertion.

I am currently working on GP techniques for generating GUI tests for Android applications.

I am also working on improving the effectiveness of GP algorithms in general by relying on semantic information.
