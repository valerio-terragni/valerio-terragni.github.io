    <p>Another research area that I am interested in is the analysis of mobile applications, with a focus on  Android applications and the Google Play Store. This is a relevant and important research area as mobile devices have become an essential delivery platform for many businesses.</p>

<p>During my PhD at HKUST, I collaborated to the project Elite a static analyzer that detects common patterns of wake lock misuses. I also collaborated with the Gran Sasso Science Institute and the University of Leipzig in the analysis of the Google Play Store for identifying emergent mobile development.</p>

<p>Currently I am working on the generation of GUI tests for Android applications. A GUI test consists of a sequence of GUI events. I am investigating concurrency bug detectors for Android Applications.</p>

    <p>Wake locks are widely used in Android apps to protect critical computations from being disrupted by device sleeping. Inappropriate use of wake locks often seriously impacts user experience. However, little is known on how wake locks are used in real-world Android apps and the impact of their misuses. To bridge the gap, we conducted a large-scale empirical study on 44,736 commercial and 31 open-source Android apps. By automated program analysis and manual investigation, we observed (1) common program points where wake locks are acquired and released, (2) 13 types of critical computational tasks that are often protected by wake locks, and (3) eight patterns of wake lock misuses that commonly cause functional and non-functional issues, only three of which had been studied by existing work. Based on our findings, we designed a static analysis technique, Elite, to detect two most common patterns of wake lock misuses. Our experiments on real-world subjects showed that Elite is effective and can outperform two state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

    <p>One of the most intriguing challenges in mobile apps development is its fragmentation with respect to mobile platforms (e.g., Android, Apple iOS, Windows Phone). Large companies like IBM and Adobe and a growing community of developers advocate hybrid mobile apps development as a possible solution to mobile platforms fragmentation. Hybrid mobile apps are consistent across platforms and built on web standards. How hybrid apps are performing in production settings is still highly debated, with limited objective evidence.In this paper, we present the first realistic investigation into mobile hybrid apps through a solid empirical strategy. Our goal is exploratory and we aim at identifying, analysing, and understanding the traits and distinctions of publicly available hybrid mobile apps within their real-life context. The study has been conducted by mining 11,917 free apps and 3,041,315 reviews from the Google Play Store, and analyzing them from both a technical and end users’ perception perspective. The results of this study build an objective and reproducible snapshot about how hybrid mobile development is performing "in the wild" in real projects.</p>
